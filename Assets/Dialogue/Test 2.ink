=== paragraph_1 ===

Whilst riding in the carriage you suddenly hear a loud meowing coming from somewhere off  the side of the road. The carriage slows down and you can all make out that the sad cries are coming from a little spirit in the form of a cat. The ghostly cat seems to have gotten itself stuck in a tree. 

    What do you do?

    * [Climb up the tree and help the cat down] -> option_1

    * [Punch the tree until the cat falls down] -> option_2
    
    * [Shoot the cat] -> option_3

=== option_1 ===
You all collaborate to climb the tree and bring the cat down. With a little convincing Orange and Purple make a human tower, allowing Blue to climb their backs and use them as a makeshift ladder to climb the tree. Green stands off to the side cheering the rescue mission on, slightly upset that she doesn't have a larger part in the rescue mission.

    The plan goes well until it's time for Blue to grab the cat. The cat, terrified by the blue scaly creature trying to grab it, scratches Blue, thus making them fall. Blue then falls onto purple, which then results in them both falling on top of orange. 
    
    Positives? Green is no longer jealous that she wasn't a part of the rescue mission!<br> Negatives? Blue, Purple and Orange all get -5 HP -> END

=== option_2 ===
Really, this is your plan? Sure, why not. You all move to stand on different sides of the tree, before you all start to simultaneously punch it. The tree is hard and its bark scratches you with each hit. You quickly realize that punching trees really isn't as fun as one would like to think, well, unless your name is Orange. Orange is going fucking in on that tree! Honestly this might be really good for him, a safe way to let out his anger! Or it's completely useless, but hey, at least the guy is having fun.

By some miracle your strategy seems to actually work and the cat eventually falls down from the tree. “Thank you for helping me down, guys!”. The cat, who apparently speaks English, gives you each +5 money before quickly scurrying away. Cool! -> END


=== option_3 ===
Really, you decided to shoot the cat? What are you guys, monsters? Oh, right, you are! The cat gets completely disintegrated and disappears in a puff of smoke, only leaving behind some pieces of gold. Why did the cat carry gold? Who cares! 

The party gets +5 money and +1 dead ghost cat on your conscience. Neat!-> END
