The carriage slows down and you are all able to make out that the sad cries seem to be coming from a little spirit in the form of a cat.

With a little convincing, Orange and Purple make a human tower, allowing Blue to use them as a makeshift ladder to climb the tree. Green stands off to the side cheering the group on, slightly upset that she doesn't have a larger part in the rescue mission.","\n","^The plan goes perfect until it's time for blue to grab the cat. The cat, terrified by the blue scaly creature, scratches Blue which makes them fall. Blue lands on top of Purple which then results in them both falling on top of Orange.","\n","^Positives?

You all move to stand on different sides of the tree and then start to simultaneously punch it. The tree is hard and its bark scratches you with each hit. You quickly realize that punching trees really isn't as fun as one would like to think, well, unless your name is Orange. Orange is going fucking in on that tree! Honestly this might be really good for him, a safe way to let out his anger! Or it's completely useless, but hey, at least the guy is having fun.","\n","^By some miracle your strategy seems to actually work and the cat eventually falls down from the tree. “Thank you for helping me down, guys!”.

All those office party performances are actually paying off! The cat's sad meows eventually quiet down only to come back louder, but happier, as it joins in on the song.","\n","^“That was great guys!
