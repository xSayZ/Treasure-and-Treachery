=== paragraph_1 ===
You open the castle door and enter to search for the evil king. After climbing what feels like unending sets of staircases, and fighting an equal amount of spirits, you finally find what you suspect to be the throne room.

Inside you find a great and luxurious hall, the sides of the walls are lined with golden statues, and at the end of the hall, in a throne, sits the king himself.
