=== paragraph_1 ===
Rusty feels the wrath grow inside of him as he is looking upon the king, his former boss and tormenter. Finally, he leaps forward and slashes at the king until he is nothing more than a pile of spirit dust.

Rusty looks for a new target, but instead sees the now empty throne before him. He sits down and feels himself relax into the cushioned seat.

<i>Now this, this he could get used to.</i>
