In this treacherous party game, up to 4 players will have to work together to defeat spirits and hurdles trying to keep them away from the evil king. But be aware, only one of you will be able to take the crown for yourself!

Treasure and Treachery is a video game created by 12 students. After 10 weeks of work including planning and prototyping to the final product, you can now experience it yourself. We recommend you play it with 4 people to experience it fully.
